# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: October 31th, 2019
**Today's progress**: Moved over to React toady. Played with FizzBuzz and tried to make it look decent and play nice on the web. Based on the reccomendations from @CoderFoundry [Youtube Video with the Recomendation](https://t.co/c6Bf4WE5Cy?amp=1).

React app is working and it was nice to jump back into the React world after a break. Really missed it.

**Thoughts:** Still not a designer apparently. Really missed React after such a long break. Kinda odd seeing the big differences after playing in Angular land.

**Total time:** Spent a bunch of time playing with this. Probably 3+ hours today. Feels longer based on the interuptions.

### Day 1: October 30th, 2019
**Today's progress**: Completed the second FCC survey project. Another ugly project. Apparently I'm not a designer. (Lots of opportunity for improvement.)

**Thoughts:** Need to ensure that working area is free of distraction. The small stuff is easy to mess up when you're getting bugged with distractions. The cat for example.

CSS is a weak point for me. More time with the responsive stuff needed. Less time with the bootstrap stuff.

**Total time:** 2hrs with distraction and messing with the CSS.

### Day 0: October 29th, 2019
**Today's progress**: Opened text editor for first time in a month. Completed Freecode Camps 'Tribute' project (although it is still ugly).

**Thoughts:** Feels good to open an editor again. Why did I stop? 

**Total time:** 2.5h for setting up project, setting up accounts (github, twitter, freecodecamp, email, etc). Probably spent 1.5 hr actually looking at the editor.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
