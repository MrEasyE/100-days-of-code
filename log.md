# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: November 8th, 2019 Continued
**Today's progress:** The best progress late today has been the habit of opening up the text editor. Once I completed my study/work yesterday, I was pulled to open up the editor again and continue building.

Opened up FCC's project list and built out their React Quote Generator in about an hour including styling. This was a big win because the style actually looks 'ok' and the quote generator is working just fine.

**Notes:** My internet connction went down and I didn't grab the technical requirements or tests that the app needs to pass from FCC. Right now it isn't setup to pass anything. It _IS_ working though. I'll come back and update it to pass the tests once I have an internet connection.

**Thoughts:** Built out the project in very short order. Some success there. The design of the generator is actually decent and functional. This is a big win.

The other massive win is the habit. This is the most exciting win so far as it relates to the #100DayCodeChallenge.

Nifty.

**Total time:** 2 hours if you include reading code camp's stuff and picking a project.

### Day 7: Novmember 8th, 2019
**Today's progress**: A lot more effort went into React. Trying to better understand the life cycle methods and looked at React Hooks. Decided to put that off for another day. I did spend some time trying to understand why we want Hooks rather than Classes, but I couldn't find a great reason. Just lots of Medium articles on HOW to use them.

**Thoughts:** React is pretty great when you're using it properly. Ran into two rabbit holes today and both times there was an easy and obvious way to solve the problem. More time in is needed I suppose.

**Total time:** 5+ hours.

### Day 3-6: November 4th - 6th, 2019
** Today's proress**: More time playing in React. Working on building a conway's game of life while on vacation.

I've built out the board and I'm changing the cell's, but currently I'm getting an undefined error. Strugging to find the error right now. Need a break.

**Thoughts:** Longer sessions are better. Pulled 8 hrs today and it was great. Yesterday and the day before were more difficult becaues of how short/distracted they were.

**Total time:** 10+ hours.

**Link to work:** N/A. Still not working properly. Update to come.

### Day 2: October 31th, 2019
**Today's progress**: Moved over to React toady. Played with FizzBuzz and tried to make it look decent and play nice on the web. Based on the reccomendations from @CoderFoundry [Youtube Video with the Recomendation](https://t.co/c6Bf4WE5Cy?amp=1).

React app is working and it was nice to jump back into the React world after a break. Really missed it.

**Thoughts:** Still not a designer apparently. Really missed React after such a long break. Kinda odd seeing the big differences after playing in Angular land.

**Total time:** Spent a bunch of time playing with this. Probably 3+ hours today. Feels longer based on the interuptions.

### Day 1: October 30th, 2019
**Today's progress**: Completed the second FCC survey project. Another ugly project. Apparently I'm not a designer. (Lots of opportunity for improvement.)

**Thoughts:** Need to ensure that working area is free of distraction. The small stuff is easy to mess up when you're getting bugged with distractions. The cat for example.

CSS is a weak point for me. More time with the responsive stuff needed. Less time with the bootstrap stuff.

**Total time:** 2hrs with distraction and messing with the CSS.

### Day 0: October 29th, 2019
**Today's progress**: Opened text editor for first time in a month. Completed Freecode Camps 'Tribute' project (although it is still ugly).

**Thoughts:** Feels good to open an editor again. Why did I stop? 

**Total time:** 2.5h for setting up project, setting up accounts (github, twitter, freecodecamp, email, etc). Probably spent 1.5 hr actually looking at the editor.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
